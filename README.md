# Soumil Kakar's School Code Repository

This is a repository for my school codes that i make through my learning journey of python in grade 11 and 12 under the CBSE curriculum.

# Repository Structure

## Core Structure:
The repository code will be broken into folders by year and then by topic.
There will be sections for practicals and assigments as well.
Any details about the code topics themselves will be mentioned in a readme in that folder.

## External Folders:
Self Learning based projects will have their own folders.
If a project turns large enough I will turn it into its own repository.
